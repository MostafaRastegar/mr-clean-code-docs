# Code Organization

This directory contains guidelines and best practices for organizing JavaScript and TypeScript code in a maintainable and scalable way.

## Overview

Proper code organization is essential for creating maintainable, scalable, and understandable applications. This section covers various aspects of code organization including project structure, module organization, naming conventions, and architectural patterns.

## Topics Covered

### [Project Structure](./project-structure.md)
Learn how to organize your project files and directories for optimal maintainability:
- Recommended directory structures for different project types
- Separation of concerns and logical grouping
- Configuration and build file organization
- Asset and resource management

### [Module Organization](./module-organization.md)
Discover best practices for organizing code into modules:
- Module design principles and patterns
- Import/export strategies and conventions
- Circular dependency prevention
- Module boundaries and encapsulation

### [Naming Conventions](./naming-conventions.md)
Establish consistent naming patterns across your codebase:
- File and directory naming conventions
- Variable, function, and class naming patterns
- Constants and configuration naming
- TypeScript-specific naming considerations

### [Architectural Patterns](./architectural-patterns.md)
Explore common architectural patterns for JavaScript and TypeScript applications:
- MVC, MVP, and MVVM patterns
- Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design
- Microservices and modular architecture
- Component-based architecture patterns

### [Code Splitting](./code-splitting.md)
Learn strategies for optimizing application performance through code splitting:
- Dynamic imports and lazy loading
- Bundle optimization techniques
- Route-based and component-based splitting
- Performance monitoring and analysis

## Key Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent patterns and conventions throughout the codebase
3. **Scalability**: Design for growth and maintainability
4. **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting and easy to understand
5. **Reusability**: Create modular, reusable components and utilities
6. **Maintainability**: Organize code to minimize complexity and technical debt

## Best Practices

- Use meaningful directory and file names
- Group related functionality together
- Maintain consistent import/export patterns
- Follow established architectural patterns
- Document your code organization decisions
- Regularly review and refactor code structure

## Getting Started

1. Analyze your project requirements and choose appropriate patterns
2. Establish consistent naming conventions
3. Design your project structure based on separation of concerns
4. Implement module boundaries and encapsulation
5. Set up build tools and configuration for your chosen architecture
6. Document your organizational decisions and conventions
